    "### Introduction\n",
    "A deep neural network (a.k.a. deep learning) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. It was proven to be highly effective for a variety of predictive tasks. In health care, deep learning is quickly gaining popularity and has been implemented for applications such as image-based diagnosis and personalized drug recommendations. In this tutorial, we will build a tailored deep-learning model for CyTOF data to diagnosis latent Cytomegalovirus infection using Keras and TensorFlow. To run this tutorial, download the [github repository](https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF) and run the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF/blob/master/DeepLearning_CyTOF.ipynb).
